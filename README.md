# CST370-Homework
Algorithm Assignments - Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Students learn important data structures in computer science and acquire fundamental algorithm design techniques to get the efficient solutions to several computing problems from various disciplines. Topics include the analysis of algorithm efficiency, hash, heap, graph, tree, sorting and searching, brute force, divide-and-conquer, decrease-and-conquer, transform-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy programming.

## Title: Main_hw0_1.java
Abstract: calculate the sum and difference of two user entered numbers

## Title: Main_hw1_1.java
Abstract: Write a program that reads input numbers from a user and displays the closest distance between two numbers among all input numbers.

## Title: Main_hw1_2.java
Abstract: Checks to see if user input is a palindrome. Exclude special characters and do not consider letter case.

## Title: Main_hw2_1.java
Abstract: Reads two timestamps of two events from a user and displays the difference between the two timestamps. Present the difference from the second event (= second timestamp) to the first event (= first timestamp). Note that the second event always happens after the first event.

## Title: Main_hw2_2.java
Abstract: The program reads a number of elements in a set given by the user, then read the elements of the set  * given by the user. After that, display all possible decimal numbers (number of unique combinations of the user  * elements), their corresponding binary numbers, and bitmap the element values to the binary numbers. It should   * look like:  
number of elements in a set given by the user--> 3  
the elements of the set given by the user-->     A B C  
                                Output Rows-->   0:000:EMPTY  
                                                 1:001:C   
                                                 2:010:B   
                                                 3:011:B C   
                                                 4:\100:A   
                                                 5:101:A C   
                                                 6:110:A B   
                                                 7:111:A B C  
## Title: Main_hw3_1.java
Abstract: The program reads the number of input values from a user then a list of entries from the user. Display the entries in ascending order. Use a short representation if there are consecutive numbers. For example, if there are three numbers such as 51, 52, and 53 in the input values, display them as 51â€“53 to save space. Assume that the input values are positive integers and there is no duplication in the input number list.  

## Title: Main_hw3_2.java
Abstract: Read graph input from a user then present a path for the TSP problem, with an     output of the path and cost.
    This program is incomplete. While I understand the mechanics of the TSP problem, implementing it programmatically was a challenge I could not meet.

## Title: Main_hw3_3.java
Abstract: The program should implement the DFS algorithm and output the mark array of the DFS.
This program is incomplete. While I understand the mechanics of DFS, implimenting it programmatically was a challenge I could not meet.

## Title: Main_hw4_1.java
Abstract: Read a number of input values and the values themselves. Then put all negative numbers in front of all positive numbers using two different methods from the study material.

## Title: Main_hw4_2.java
Abstract: display the largest number in an array with n integer numbers using a divide-and-conquer technique.

## Title: Main_hw4_3.java
Abstract: Conducts a topological sorting based on the Kahn algorithm. This does not fulfill; the assignment requirement, however, it will take a user input per the spec, and print the adjacency matrix to the console.

## Title: Main_hw5_1.java
Abstract: Program conducts heap operations based on user input.

## Title: Main_hw5_2.java
Abstract: Display the performance of two different sorting algorithms (merge sort and quick sort)
MergeSort written by and found at  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/
QuickSort written and found at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-program-for-quicksort/

## Title: Main_hw5_3.java
Abstract: simulate the operations of linear probing

## Title: Main_hw6_1.java
Abstract: Collect maximum number of coins on an n x m board

## Title: Main_hw6_2.java
Abstract: Implements the Floyd algorithm to display all-pairs shortest paths
